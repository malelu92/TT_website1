  	<p><b>Encourage habit formation</b></p>
  </div>
    	<p class="caption-text explanation">Encouraging habit formation is one of the biggest challenges that we faced for encouraging people to prepare for disasters. To overcome this, we imagine this solution to be embedded within an app that is used regularly such as a prescription application that can be used by hospitals to give to their patients to keep a log of their prescriptions. It can also be used while being embedded in existing apps such as Facebook, Google Maps or existing medical device apps such as (Phillips Respironics).</p>

  	<p><b>Simplify registration</b></p>
  </div>
  <p class="caption-text explanation">
We also saw that medical needs shelters currently donâ€™t have enough registrations, having a quick look at the form made us realize that these are extensive and full of fields that could be prefilled by available patient information by the hospitals. We mocked-up a form that only asks for the missing key information from the special needs person.In cases where the special needs citizen is not comfortable using app, their caregiver can fill it for them.</p>

  	<p><b>Progressive reminders</b></p>
  </div>
  <p class="caption-text explanation">
  	A hurricanes path is predicted, 72 hours before it is about to hit, if the patients home or shelter falls in the path, you are redirected to other places.It is at this time that the user is prompted to mention how many people will be accompanying them to the shelter.  Our research shows that progressive reminders compel specific actions that are important during a disaster. It also optimizes actions depending on disaster timeline.

  	<p><b>Demonstrate authority</b></p>
  </div>
  <p class="caption-text explanation">When the patient starts moving towards the shelter, users are shown an optimized route and also given an estimated arrival time for their shelter. A progress bar helps them keep track of the shelters capacity and also compels them to take action promptly.  We learned that during disasters, citizens respond very well to authoritative instructions during disasters. It reduces their cognitive load and decision fatigue.</p>

  	<p><b>Contact help</b></p>
  	</div>
  	<p class="caption-text explanation">
Homeland Security says that 6 hours before a hurricane is about to hit, citizens should stay where they are. Using the location data, if the app detects that the user has not left their house, it recommends them to stay at home and also provides tips for how to stay safe. Emergency responders are alerted about these users so they can take actions in these places first.</p>
