								<div>
									<p class="home_topic">THE PROBLEM</p>
									<p>Hospitals have an important role to play in a community, especially during disasters where stressed-out citizens choose to seek refuge inside the hospitalâ€™s facilities. But surges of people sheltering at hospitals can compromise operations and quality of patient care. How might we design a system that balances these two needs?</p>
									<p class="home_topic">CLIENT BRIEF</p>
									<p>During natural disasters like hurricanes, hospitals can become a place refuge for ordinary citizens, especially those with long-term medical conditions and their caretakers. This influx of people is difficult to size, predict, and manage and can overwhelm the hospital. Our goal is to create a solution which makes key hospital data (capacity, staffing, resources) more transparent and enable affected citizens to make a more rational decision about where to shelter when they cannot do so safely inside their own homes.
